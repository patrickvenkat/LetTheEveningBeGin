# LetTheEveningBeGin
Group Project 1

A perfect blend of weather and cocktails -

A responsive app that uses HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, and APIs.
  Our APIs are Open Weather Map and Cocktail DB.

The user enters his or her city and is recommended drinks based on the weather of that city. 
The app comes complete with instructions and ingredients for the cocktail chosen by the user from the recommended list.

Our 'icebox' includes features such as a targeted city and state search, as well as the capability to get the weather for a future date.
